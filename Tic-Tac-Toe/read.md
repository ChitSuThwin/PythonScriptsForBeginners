## TIC-TAC-TOE GAME / Pygame
Requirements : Pygame distribution.
#### 1)How to start the game?
You need to run the python file,then a GUI will be opened .Basically it has start and quit buttons.
   -> BY DEFAULT
    	a)By simply clicking the start button 3x3 tic tac toe game will be started, where user needs to play his turns with AI.
    	b)By choosing Basic minimax and then starting the game leads to a game played with AI which uses minimax alogorithm.
    	c)By choosing alpha beta pruning and then starting the game leads to a game played with AI which uses min
                   d)By choosing minimax with depth limit and then starting the game also leads to the game played with AI which is pretty similar
    	e)By choosing minimax with alpha beta pruning and depth limit and starting the games also leads to the same 3x3 game but the function used behind is different
    IF 4 and 4 is given to enter the size and winning condition blocks,same as above but 4x4 game is played instead of 3x3 but the functions minmax ,alpha-beta 
    and dl minmax wont run tends to more running time
    IF 5 and 5 is given to enter the size and winning condition blocks,same as above but 5x5 game is played instead of 4x4

#### WARNINGS:
Algorithms 1,2 and 3 only work in a reasonable amount of time upto 3 by 3 grids.
Algorithm 4 works in a reasonable amount of time upto 4 by 4 grids in an optimal time.
Algorithm 5 works in a reasonable amount of time upto 6 by 6 grids in an optimal time.
